# Monitor Hub

## Overview

Monitor Hub is a simple docker container that enables you to view logs from all of the running docker services. It was created to make it easier for users of the SDR-E (and probably any docker user) to view the logs of all of the running services in one place without SSH-ing in to the box and running `docker logs` on each container.

## Usage / Getting Started

```yaml
  monitor-hub:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/monitor-hub:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: monitor-hub
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    environment:
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

Currently, the container will initially show only 10 lines of logs from each container. Once connected, new lines from the containers are appended and you can scroll through them. Loading the page took forever without this limitation with any number of containers that had been running. This will be improved in future versions.

The webpage is a bit basic. While this entire project doesn't need much complication, it's a bit basic for my liking.

If a container SHOULD be running, but it is not, the webpage will not show it. This will be improved in future versions.

A potential future improvement would be to add a search bar to filter the containers shown.

Another potential future improvement would be to clean up log entries by removing the container-added time stamp and using the docker daemon one. If you see two time stamps, it's because of this.

A last future potential improvement would be to enable some level of container management, ie pulling new images, stopping/restarting, etc.
